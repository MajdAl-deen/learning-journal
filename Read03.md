# What did I get from doing lab 03?
Afert checking my pervious work for **Growth mindset** and **lab01** I have edit some mistaks using Visual studio Code and that leads to learn new orders and terms using Ububtu.

## The first term was version control
Is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### The new orders that I get was :
* **git clon** : this order helps me to get my work from gethub.
* **git status** : this code allows me to check if my wark has been saved or not.
* **git add** : this order to make sure that I am in the right file that I have change anything on it.
* **git commit -m "my comment"**: this order is to save my work that I have done and allows me to write a brief about my changes in my file.
* **git push origin master** : this order is to upload my work that I have saved on my account on gethub.
* **git add** : this order is to save any change that I have made in all files.
