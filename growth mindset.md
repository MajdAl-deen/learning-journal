## Markdown
### Definition of markdown:
It is a semple way to design your text by using certain symbols like # or * and other symbols also gives us other features that could help us to write somthing special by adding an image or links.

### How to designing your words?

**for example** we can make our text bold by writing our text betwen those symbols ****  **our text** or by writting our words between
( __ __ ) __to make our words alos bold__ and we can make it italic by writing it between this symbols **  *our text* or by butting our words between (_ _) _to give us italic font_ .

### How to change the font size?

We can write a big header in a by adding (#) in the bigging of the text and this is similer to write an h1 tag in HTML.
Also we can write in a smaller size than adding a (#) by adding two of them (##)and this is similer to write an h2 tag in HTML and so on up to six heading sizes, when we want to make the font size smaller to the header we just add one (#) in the begging of our writing.

### How to make a lists in defferent types?
If we have to count somthing and we want to write it by numbers we just write (1. 2. 3. and ect..) like:
1. January
2. Febuary
3. March
4. April
If we want to mention some point with out numbring them and you just want a bullet points we can use this symbole (* ) in the beginning of the line or the point that we want to write about it or by using the Dash (- ) in the bigging of the point like:

- Lisetn carefully
- Analaiys what we have listen 
- Talk in a short way 

**OR** using the star symbole like:
* Stady
* Ready
* Go

**And both of them give us the same resulte**

We can also insert a subpoints by puting two spaces before the Dashe or the star and we will get the resulte we want like:
- stady
  - Focus
- ready
  - Be prepared
- go
  - Make your full effort
  
  ### How to insert an image ??
  
  If we are selling a product we can insert an image of this product by writing Image of the product between ![] and we copy the image address and put it between () like:
  
![image of a product](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/04839a_b4d0c16c316d49b68c12dee6f0920ce4.jpg)

**If we want to visit the main page of our product we can insert a link by naming the product website and put it between [] then we copy the product website and but it between ().**
