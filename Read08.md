# Learn how to compare in Javascript

## First we going to check the tools that let me to compare between thing which is called comparsion operaitors

* *The == tool*: this tools gives me *true* if I compare between things with the same datatype like numbers if they were equal gives me true or the strings if they are the same it will give me true.
* *The != tool*: this one gives me true when things are wrong it is call unequal so when I write 1 != 2 it will give me true.
* *The === tool*:this tool will give me true when the data type and the value are both equal like '3' === '3' is true because they have the same value and datatype.
* *The !== tool*=this tool gives me true when the datatype and the value are not the same it like unequal but it checks the datatype and the value.
* *The <= tool*:this allows me to compare between two values if the the value on the left is equal or smaller than the value on the right.
* *The >= tool*:this allows me compare between two numbers to check if the number on the left is bigger or equal the number on the right.
## We could use logical operaitors to compare between coparsion operatiors

### We have two logical operaitors to use and they called *(AND,OR,NOT)*

* AND: will be represinted by this symbol && and if we compare between two results and one of them is false the AND resulte will be false
*  OR: will be represinted by this symbol || and if we copmare between tow results and onr of them is true the OR resulte will be true
*  NOT: will be represinted by this symbol ! and when we use it the boolean value will change so when we use it when the sentens is true it changes it to false.

**other way to write the above logical is like *False && anything* or *true || anything* make it stops if it found a falsu in the first one and the second one it stops if there is any true.**
