## What Is A Text Editor?
For the layman, Text Editor means a Notepad kind of software that can be used to write plain texts and also edit the same as
and when required. For a web developer, a Text Editor is primarily software that they can use to write and manage text,

Every software has two sides to it, some good and some bad. No two software generally share the same features. So instead of
talking about the best software available for coding, let us first talk about the features that you must look for while selecting
the default text editor for yourself.

1. The first basic feature of any text editor is *speed*. If the software you are using is hampering your speed, you are ought 
   to look for alternatives. Speed can vary due to many reasons, be it the underlying mechanism or the size, but it doesnâ€™t matter.

2. The next important criterion is *Extension Support*. Most software have started including a host of extension support, but if 
  the language that you have chosen to code is less-recognized, make sure you get the text editor that has good extension support.

3. The next point to consider is the *domain support*. Every coder can get into some problems or the other, but those can be common
ones or domain-related. What if the specific editor you chose is not able to handle the domain properly? This problem can be solved 
to an extent if the text editor is friendly to the domain you choose to excel in.

4. This is one of the most important *aspects to consider*, the Learning Curve Timespan.So try to choose one which will have a shorter
Learning Curve Timespan.
