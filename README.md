## markdown
### Definition of markdown:
it is a semple way to design your text by using certain symbols like # or * and other symbols.

**for example** we can make our text bold by writing our text betwen those symbols ****  **our text** or by writting our words between
( __ __ ) __to make our words alos bold__ and we can make it italic by writing it between this symbols **  *our text* or by butting our words between (_ _) _to give us italic font_ .

### How to change the font size?

We can write a big header in a by adding (#) in the bigging of the text and this is similer to write an h1 tag in HTML.
Also we can write in a smaller size than adding a (#) by adding two of them (##)and this is similer to write an h2 tag in HTML and so on,when we want to make the font size smaller that the header we just add more (#) in the begging of our writing.

### How to make a lists in defferent types?
If we have to count somthing and we want to write it by numbers we just write (1. 2. 3. and ect..) like:
1. January
2. Febuary
3. March
4. April
If we want to mention some point with out numbring them and you just want a bullet points we can use this symbole (* ) in the beginning of the line or the point that we want to write about it or by using the Dash (- ) in the bigging of the point like:

- Lisetn carefully
- Analaiys what we have listen 
- Talk in a short way 

**OR** using the star symbole like:
* Stady
* Ready
* Go

**And both of them give us the same result**
