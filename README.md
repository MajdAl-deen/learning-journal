## markdown
### Definition of markdown:
it is a semple way to design your text by using certain symbols like # or *

**for example** we can make our text bold by writing our text betwen those symbols ****  **our text** and we can make it italic by writing it between this symbols **  *our text*

### How to change the font size?

We can write a big header in a by adding (#) in the bigging of the text and this is similer to write an h1 tag in HTML.
Also we can write in a smaller size than adding a (#) by adding two of them (##)and this is similer to write an h2 tag in HTML and so on,when we want to make the font size smaller that the header we just add more (#) in the begging of our writing.
